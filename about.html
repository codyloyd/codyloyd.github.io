      <h3>about me</h3>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>
          For better or worse, I am a completely self-taught programmer...<br>
          I am currently a High School band teacher, and while I do love that job, I have always been fascinated by technology, so not too long ago I began teaching myself how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't initially have any specific goals in mind, and I certainly wasn't looking for a career change, but as I started to dig in I discovered that I actually <em>really</em> liked it.  I found myself spending almost all my free time doing projects, reading articles and going through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, at an accelerated rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only three months after beginning to learn, I was invited to join the moderating team at The Odin Project, where I hang around helping new learners, and contributing to the ongoing improvement of the curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as my personal life, I live in Missouri with my wife and three kids. Besides programming I have an intense love for music. I play guitar and compose music, which you can check out  <a href="#">here</a>, if you like.
