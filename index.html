      <h1>ABOUT <span class="blue">ME</span></h1>
       <p>
         For better or worse, I am a completely self-taught programmer.
         For years I worked as a high school band teacher in a small school district in Missouri, but in April of 2016 I decided to learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't initially have any specific goals in mind, and I certainly wasn't looking for a career change, but as I started to dig in I discovered that I actually <em>really</em> liked it, and I was actually quite good at it as well.  I found myself spending almost all my free time doing projects, reading articles and going through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>,which was my primary learning resource, especially in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost exactly a year after diving in I was offered a position as a front-end web developer and I decided to go ahead with the career shift.  I've written a little more about my Journey <a href="https://medium.com/@codyloyd/from-0-to-employed-in-one-year-45e3787d1b50">here</a>.  These days I work from home most of the time and I'm loving it!
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as my personal life, I live in Missouri with my wife and three kids. Besides programming I have an intense love for music, I was a band teacher after all. I play guitar in my church band and compose music, which you can check out below, if you like.

      <h1>TUTORING</h1>
      <p>
        I offer tutoring to people who are just learning to code.  Everyone knows that pair-programming (programming <em>with</em> someone else) is a fantastic way to boost your skillset.  Working with someone that is more advanced than you can shortcut the frustrations of trying to figure things out all on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am flexible with what I am able to offer, but ideally the setup would include a couple of screen-sharing sessions throughout the week and regular email and text chat support.  If this is something you're interested in, contact me using the form at the bottom of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pricing is variable based on demand and the specifics of our plan (i.e. how often we meet) but I guarantee I'll be cheaper than a college degree or a bootcamp.

      <h1>MY <span class="blue">MUSIC</span></h1>
      <p>
      I love music.. and I enjoy composing and producing it.  I am currently a high school band teacher by profession, regularly play guitar in my church's band and I have two other musical projects as well. 
      </p>
      <h3>FILM MUSIC</h3>
      <p>
        There is no film associated with this music of course, but I enjoy composing and producing this style of music. If you are needing music for a project and want to use one of these tracks, or if you are needing some original music composed, feel free to contact me.
