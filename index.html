      <h1>ABOUT <span class="blue">ME</span></h1>
       <p>
         For better or worse, I am a completely self-taught programmer.
         For years I worked as a high school band teacher in a small school district in Missouri, but in April of 2016 I decided to learn to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't initially have any specific goals in mind, and I certainly wasn't looking for a career change, but as I started to dig in I discovered that I actually <em>really</em> liked it, and I was pretty good at it as well.  I found myself spending almost all my free time doing projects, reading articles and going through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>,which was my primary learning resource, especially in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost exactly a year after diving in I was offered a position as a front-end web developer and I decided to go ahead with the career shift.  I've written a little more about my Journey <a href="https://medium.com/@codyloyd/from-0-to-employed-in-one-year-45e3787d1b50">here</a>.  These days I work from home most of the time and I'm loving it!
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as my personal life, I live in Missouri with my wife and three kids. Besides programming I have an intense love for music, I was a band teacher after all. I play guitar in my church band and compose music, which you can check out below, if you like. Recently, I've begun learning to play the piano and I can confidently say I'm horrible at it.  I've been posting progress vids on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/codytacoloyd/videos">YouTube</a>.. so if that's your type of thing, feel free to go laugh at me a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend a decent amount of my free-time helping people learn to code or jazz up their web-designs and over the last couple years I've even had some people offer to pay me for helping them.  I'm not looking to start a mentoring business or anthing like that, but enough people have mentioned it that I decided to set up a "Buy me a coffee" page.  If I've helped you in some way and you fancy giving back, click the button! I will almost definitely be spending the cash on ACTUAL coffee.

                Good Luck.
